This is a node project, that allows developers to validate the schema of their JSON with defined JSON schema in the project before they commit the json to git.
This will help developers in validating their JSON before its committed to git and will help in avoiding run time errors caused due to missing keys in JSON or invalide value formats.

To run this, you need node installed. After copying the files in folder, just run npm-intall and you are good to go.
Define your custom json schema against which you want to validate the json.
